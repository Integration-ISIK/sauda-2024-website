                    In the hallowed corridors of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), there existed a luminary whose influence transcended the conventional boundaries of academia. Professor Saurabh Ghosh, affectionately known as "Sauda," cast a profound and enduring spell upon the tapestry of student life, emerging not merely as an educator but as a mentor, confidante, and a custodian of the intellectual sanctum.

Within the cloisters of ISI, Sauda was more than a teacher; he was a friend, philosopher, and guide, an embodiment of sagacity who navigated the labyrinthine academic landscape with an unparalleled finesse. His association with the esteemed institution went beyond the confines of a conventional pedagogue; he was the students' man in the Dean's Office, the repository of knowledge, and the orchestrator of an unwavering camaraderie that fostered a nurturing environment for intellectual growth.

Sauda's classroom was not merely a space for disseminating information; it was a crucible of ideas, a forum where intellectual curiosity thrived under the aegis of a compassionate mentor. His penchant for infusing levity into the most austere of subjects was legendary, transforming mundane conversations into moments of enlightenment. The palpable aura of his humor, described by one alumnus as "a breath of fresh air," not only alleviated the academic rigors but also became an indelible aspect of the ISI experience.

Beyond the realms of academia, Sauda was a jovial senior, a mentor who extended his benevolent guidance to the bewildered initiates, providing a steady anchor in the tumultuous sea of academia. Yet, beneath the jovial exterior lay the formidable paper setter whose assessments were both revered and dreaded—a testament to his commitment to scholarly rigor.

As we gather to celebrate the life and legacy of Sauda, let us reflect upon the indomitable spirit that he infused into the corridors of ISI. His memory lives on not merely in the pages of academic transcripts but in the hearts and minds of those fortunate enough to have been touched by his wisdom. Professor Saurabh Ghosh, alias Sauda, was not just an educator; he was the custodian of an invaluable legacy—a legacy that continues to shape the intellectual tapestry of ISI and resonate in the grateful hearts of his students.
