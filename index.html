                    In the hallowed corridors of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), there existed a luminary whose influence transcended the conventional boundaries of academia. Professor Saurabh Ghosh, affectionately known as "Sauda," cast a profound and enduring spell upon the tapestry of student life, emerging not merely as an educator but as a mentor, confidante, and a custodian of the intellectual sanctum.

                    Within the cloisters of ISI, Sauda was more than a teacher; he was a friend, philosopher, and guide, an embodiment of sagacity who navigated the labyrinthine academic landscape with an unparalleled finesse. His association with the esteemed institution went beyond the confines of a conventional pedagogue; he was the students' man in the Dean's Office, the repository of knowledge, and the orchestrator of an unwavering camaraderie that fostered a nurturing environment for intellectual growth.

                    Sauda's classroom was not merely a space for disseminating information; it was a crucible of ideas, a forum where intellectual curiosity thrived under the aegis of a compassionate mentor. His penchant for infusing levity into the most austere of subjects was legendary, transforming mundane conversations into moments of enlightenment. The palpable aura of his humor, described by one alumnus as "a breath of fresh air," not only alleviated the academic rigors but also became an indelible aspect of the ISI experience.

                    Beyond the realms of academia, Sauda was a jovial senior, a mentor who extended his benevolent guidance to the bewildered initiates, providing a steady anchor in the tumultuous sea of academia. Yet, beneath the jovial exterior lay the formidable paper setter whose assessments were both revered and dreaded—a testament to his commitment to scholarly rigor.

                    As we gather to celebrate the life and legacy of Sauda, let us reflect upon the indomitable spirit that he infused into the corridors of ISI. His memory lives on not merely in the pages of academic transcripts but in the hearts and minds of those fortunate enough to have been touched by his wisdom. Professor Saurabh Ghosh, alias Sauda, was not just an educator; he was the custodian of an invaluable legacy—a legacy that continues to shape the intellectual tapestry of ISI and resonate in the grateful hearts of his students.

                 Dr. Ghosh was Professor and Head of the Human Genetics Unit at the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata (ISI). 
                    He received his undergraduate, masters, and Ph.D. degrees in Statistics from the ISI, pursued postdoctoral training in the Department of Psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, finally returning as faculty to the ISI in 2003.
                    His latest work focused on developing methodologies for genetic association analyses of multivariate and comorbid phenotypes as well as for integration of high dimensional genomic and epigenetic data to predict disease risk. In addition to methodological developments, he was the statistical coordinator of multicentric Indian projects on the genetics of Type 2 Diabetes and major psychosis. 
                    Dr. Ghosh was an active member of International Genetic Epidemiology Society (IGES) for over 20 years, and has been the most familiar face of India in the Society. His work with the Society championed the inclusion of researchers across the globe. While Chair of the IGES Membership Committee, his group introduced “Ambassadors” to countries that had minimal representation in the Society to encourage participation, along with differential membership and meeting registration rates for members working in low income countries. 
                    He participated in major national outreach initiatives to disseminate expertise in Statistical Genetics and Genetic Epidemiology through a large number of hands-on Workshops. His work was internationally recognized, as an Associate of the Indian Academy of Sciences, a Fellow of the Indian Society for Medical Statistics, and a member of the Task Force for Big Data Sciences in Life Sciences, Government of India. He was also an active member of International Biometric Society. 
                    His research interests was Linkage and Association Studies for complex human disorders, Mapping in the presence of epistatic interactions, Genetic Analysis of multifactorial traits and multivariate phenotypes.
                    The tapestry of his career within ISI was woven with threads of distinction, as accolades and honors adorned his academic journey. The culmination of these laurels manifested in his ascension to the esteemed position of the Dean of Studies in 2022, a testament to his scholarly eminence and administrative acumen. In this role, he not only steered the academic ship of ISI with sagacity but also assumed the mantle of a custodian, overseeing the intellectual development of the institute's progeny.

The echoes of Professor Saurabh Ghosh's contributions resonate in the corridors of ISI, where his legacy is etched not only in the scrolls of academic achievement but also in the collective memory of those who were privileged to be his students and colleagues. His untimely departure on the 3rd of October, 2022, cast a shadow over the institution he had so ardently served. As we pay tribute to his memory, we acknowledge not only the academic luminary but the compassionate mentor whose imprint on ISI transcends the boundaries of time.

In the tapestry of ISI's history, Prof. Ghosh's narrative remains a luminous thread, weaving together the realms of academia, mentorship, and administrative stewardship. May his legacy endure, an eternal flame that illuminates the corridors of wisdom within the institution he cherished and enriched.
